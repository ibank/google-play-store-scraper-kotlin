## ⚖️ Legal Precedents and Case Law

### Relevant Cases

**hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp.** (9th Cir. 2022)
- Held that scraping publicly accessible data may not violate CFAA
- **BUT**: This project's use of detection avoidance techniques may not qualify for this protection

**Van Buren v. United States** (U.S. Supreme Court 2021)
- Narrowed CFAA "exceeds authorized access" interpretation
- **BUT**: Does not protect against ToS violations with technical circumvention

**Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc.** (9th Cir. 2016)
- ToS violations + continued access after cease and desist = CFAA violation
- **Warning**: Demonstrates ToS violations can lead to criminal liability

### Key Takeaway

Legal precedents are **jurisdiction-specific** and **fact-dependent**. The use of circumvention techniques in this software significantly weakens legal defenses available in the above cases.
